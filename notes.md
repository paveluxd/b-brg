Ring charges don't work.

**Update notes**
- Fixed a bug when *Undying* passive would bug the live value on death.
- Fixed a bug when healing gained via *House* map event would result in bugged live value.

- To-do ideas**
    - Passive: +1 exp when you use a scroll.
    - Do burning dot.
    - Add coin related passive.
    - Item that hits through block enemy action.
    - Add treasure items that take N inventory capacity and sell for a lot of coins.
    - Add sharpening stone to repair weapons.
    - Add trap tile that requires agility roll or minigame.
    - Fractional stat bonuses on items.
    - Add rounding to stats with fraction, and show it in UI.

    *POI ideas*
    - +5 max life

    *Item ideas*
    - Potion that mixes stats
    - Torch
    - Shield that blocks equal to it's charge (10 charge).


- Bugs
    - All items of the same type are enchanted (bags, body etc)
    - Lance (dmg equal to powe (cost 1p)) -> spear?
    - Shards ==(3 x empty slot) -> ?

- Story notes
    - You play as a hystorian that tries to restore the chronology of events discovered on relics.
